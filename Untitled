🏫 Brightwheel Front Desk AI

A production-ready Intelligent Assistant for Child Development Centers. Built with a focus on Safety-First RAG and Dynamic Policy Control.
🛠️ Architecture

This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide grounded, factual answers based on school handbooks.

    LLM: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2(via Amazon Bedrock)
    Framework: Next.js 15+, Tailwind CSS, Vercel AI SDK
    Data: JSON-based Knowledge Base with real-time RAM-state management.

🌟 Key Engineering Features

    Dynamic Context Injection: The system prioritizes "Critical Protocols" over general policies to ensure child safety.
    Operator-in-the-Loop: Admins can edit policies in real-time. Edits trigger a global cache invalidation to ensure immediate AI alignment.
    Safety Guardrails: Internal "Operator Notes" guide the AI's logic (e.g., triage/escalation) without exposing internal technical instructions to parents.
    Latency Monitoring: Built-in telemetry to track AI vs. Cache response times.
